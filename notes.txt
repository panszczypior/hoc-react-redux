// HOC - combining normal component with higher order component which produces 'enhanced' or 'composed' component (component with additional functionality or data)

// example might be HOC over authentication component, it should resolve if user is logged or not

// how to use HOC ?

// import Authentication <- this is HOC
// import Resources <- this is component I want to wrap

// const ComposedComponent = Authentication(Resources);

//in some render method... <ComposedComponent />
